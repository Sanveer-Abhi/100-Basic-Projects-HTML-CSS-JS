    <h1>Mouse Cursor Project</h1>
    <p>
      The Mouse Cursor Project is an interactive web application that
      demonstrates advanced cursor customization techniques using HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. This project allows developers to move beyond the standard
      browser cursor and create unique, custom cursor experiences that enhance
      user interaction and engagement. The project showcases how to replace the
      default system cursor with custom images or animations that follow the
      user's mouse movements across the webpage. This is achieved through a
      combination of CSS cursor properties and JavaScript event listeners that
      track real-time mouse position data. Users will learn how to implement
      smooth cursor animations, create hover effects for interactive elements,
      and develop cursor trails or glow effects that respond dynamically to user
      interaction. Key features include tracking mouse coordinates in real-time,
      applying CSS transforms to position custom cursor elements, and handling
      various states such as hovering over buttons or clickable elements. The
      project demonstrates the importance of user experience (UX) design by
      showing how custom cursors can provide visual feedback and make web
      applications feel more polished and professional. This project is
      particularly useful for front-end developers looking to expand their
      skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS animations. It
      provides practical examples of mouse event listeners such as mousemove,
      mouseenter, and mouseleave, which are fundamental concepts in interactive
      web development. By completing this project, learners will understand how
      to create responsive cursor behaviors, optimize performance for smooth
      animations, and implement accessible design practices. The Mouse Cursor
      Project serves as an excellent foundation for building more complex
      interactive features in web applications, including game development,
      creative portfolios, and engaging user interface designs.
