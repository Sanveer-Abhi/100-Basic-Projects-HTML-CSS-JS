          Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
          content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
          technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages
          such as JavaScript.

          Cascading Style Sheets is the styling language used to control the
          layout, design, and visual presentation of web pages. It lets
          developers manage colors, spacing, responsiveness, animations, and
          overall UI aesthetics efficiently across multiple pages.

          JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic scripting language that enables
          interactive and dynamic behavior on websites. It powers everything
          from animations and form validation to full web applications, APIs,
          and backend services with Node.js.

          React is a modern JavaScript library for building fast, scalable user
          interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture and virtual DOM to
          create highly efficient, reusable UI elements for both web and mobile
          applications.
